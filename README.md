# Swap_numbers
In this code, we are swapping two numbers. First, we take input from the user for both the numbers. Then, we create a variable called "a" and store the value of num1 in it. After that, we store the value of num2 in the num1 variable and the value of a in the num2 variable. Finally, we print the values of both the variables before and after swapping.
